<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
<p>As avid fans of reality TV, we are fascinated by the phenomenon that is the Bachelor/Bachelorette universe. Each season, millions of people create brackets and even bet money on the contestants and their outcomes. Using previous years’ Bachelor data, we hope to give people actionable insights and trends for their brackets and gossip among friends. Although on the surface analyzing reality TV may seem purely trivial, we hope to use this data to provide insights to help win your bracket or find your next lover in real life.</p>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<p>We would like to create a visualization based on the outcome data from previous seasons to determine how certain characteristics correlate with contestant outcomes. We can answer questions like: </p>
<ul>
<li>Which occupations get sent home the earliest?</li>
<li>Which hometown or home state has had the most success?</li>
<li>What is the threshold of age that you need to win?</li>
<li>What characteristics make a contestant likely to be the next Bachelor/Bachelorette?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our visualization will allow the show's viewers to make more accurate bets and predictions on the contestant outcomes. It will be an interactive, entertaining platform for fans to explore the show's history and statistics. </p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<a href="https://data.world/amandanovak/bachelor-contestants-with-instagram-follower-count/workspace/data-dictionary">Data Source 1</a>
<p>We got this from data.world which is an innovative platform with open source datasets and was published on 8/28/2017. Two files are given, one in an xlsx and one given in a csv. We will manipulate, append, and combine both of those into another csv file, which we will combine and then serve using a python server for our data analysis.</p>
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brianbgonz/the-bachelorette-contestants#bachelors.csv">Data Source 2</a>
<p>We also have additional information on the bachelor for each individual season from Kaggle, so we can compare the bachelor’s characteristics with that of the candidates.</p>

<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>We expect some data cleanup. We have two files with different categories and different missing data elements, so we’ll combine the two into a new dataset and scrape the missing data.</p>

<h2>Must-Have Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Trees that show the week-by-week outcomes of each contestant in each season</li>
<li>Charts comparing the outcomes by characteristics (ex. Home state, occupation industry)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optional Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>List the features which you consider to be nice to have, but not critical.</li>
<li>Map with home city and state</li>
<li>Instagram follower count analysis</li>
<li>Comparison of similarities between the bachelor and the contestants</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Schedule</h2>
<p>We plan to divide work by assigning each team member a visualization that will be incorporated into a cohesive web page. We will meet weekly to catch up on our progress, help each other improve our work, and integrate all of our parts.<br>
Group Meeting - 3/25<br>
Group Meeting - 4/1</p>
<ul>
    <li>Submit Milestone I - a functional project prototype (due Apr 1)</li>

<h2>Visualization Design</h2>
<p>Design sketches for our visualization are shown below. The primary view will be an interactive tree depicting the week-by-week progress of contestants on a given season of The Bachelor. Users will then be able to choose amongst various characteristics to gain more information.  We are providing a map view to visualize the contestants' home towns as well as an occupation chart visualizing occupation popularity and success rate.</p>

<h1>Milestone 1</h1>
<p>Our first milestone submission includes two visualizations of characteristics of the
Bachelor contestants. </p>

<p>The map visualization has a marker for each contestant in their
hometown. Clicking on the marker shows more information about that contestant. We plan on color coding the visualization by contestant outcomes (elimination weeks). We also
would like to add an interactive feature for users to zoom in on selected regions.</p>

<p>The occupations bubble chart displays the main job categories of the contestants. The size of the bubble indicates frequency while the color indicates average elimination week. The next step to improving this visualization is making it more interactive with the ability to zoom in on a bubble and see more information. We also plan on improving the overall appearance of the visualization (wrapping text within bubbles, improved color scale, etc). </p>

<br><h3>Milestone 1 Website</h3><br>

<h1>Milestone 2</h1>
<p>Our second milestone submission includes three visualizations. </p>
<ul>
    <li>The "Season Outcomes" displays the week-to-week outcomes of each season on a rose, a well-known symbol of the Bachelor,
        Each row represents a group of contestants that was eliminated each week, with the winner appearing in the flower.
    </li>
    <li>
        The "Contestant Hometowns" has been improved from Milestone 1 as the markers are now color coded to indicate the
        contestants' progress. It is also interactive and more informative since the markers can be filtered. The accompanying
        bar graph provides a different visualization of the same data for greater understanding of the number of contestants
        from each state.
    </li>
    <li>
        The "Contestant Occupations" has been improved from Milestone 1 as clicking on a job category bubble zooms into
        that category and shows an bubble chart of the most common job titles. This provides more information and understanding
        about each job category. This visualization will be further improved for the final submission by adding a tooltip so that
        one can see the frequency and average elimination week of the jobs.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>User Studies</h1>
<p>We had three users who had not previously seen our visualization test it and provide feedback. First,
    they used our website while talking us through their initial thoughts. Then, we had them perform three tasks.
    Lastly, we asked questions about their experience using our website.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>User 1 was unsure of some of the functions available on our website, for instance, whether
        he would need to hover for a tooltips or click for more information. Based on this feedback,
        we provided more information on functionality and meanings of our visualizations in the instructions. </li>
    <li>User 2 mentioned that he did not understand the "flow" of our website. This lead us to place more detailed
        instructions at the top of the website. He also asked for more clarifying details in each visualization, such as
        each rose on the map representing one contestant.</li>
    <li>User 3 had not heard of The Bachelor, and was therefore unfamiliar with the content of our
        website. This left us with feedback that was mostly centered around clarifying the
        purpose of our visualizations. We improved upon this by explaining why we created each visualization
        and where appropriate, adding supporting visualizations to make our findings even clearer.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three users were able to complete the tasks that we prepared:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Who won in Season 21? What hometown were they from? (Vanessa, Quebec)</li>
    <li>How many contestants were from the state of California in Season 15? (3) </li>
    <li>What was the most common occupation in the Law Category? (Attorney)</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the user studies informed us that we needed to add more clarification and explanation
    to our website.</p>


<h1>The Final Visualization</h1>
<p>Our visualization answers the main questions that we were determined to answer at the beginning of the project,
    including what occupations and hometowns, two things that are often emphasized throughout the TV show, have
    resulted in the greatest success in the competition. We also created a visualization that allows the show's fans
    to browse the show's history, allowing them to reminisce on the seasons they enjoyed watching, as well as gain insights
    on contestant characteristics for when they watch the show in the future. Below, we'll discuss our findings and challenges
    discovered in creating each visualization.
</p>
<h2>Season Outcomes</h2>
    <p>The season tree visualization is a great tool for catching up on past seasons.  It is useful for viewing not only information about when each contestant was eliminated, but also how the final couple is doing today.  For example, we noticed that the only couple that is still currently married is Sean and Catherine from season 17.  We also noticed that it is much more common in the recent seasons for the bachelor to propose on the show, while in the earlier seasons, most couples never were engaged.  We also learned that season 11 was the only season in which no winner was chosen when the bachelor rejected both the final 2 contestants.</p>
<h2>Contestant Hometowns</h2>
    <p>The hometowns visualization has led us to the conclusion that the Bachelor casting team is very purposeful with
        their selections to ensure a wide variety of locations. When breaking it down by each season, there is practically
        a uniform distribution, with one contestant hailing from each of the most populated states in the US, and then a few
        outliers that may be from less populated states or other countries.
    </p>
<h2>Contestant Occupations</h2>
    <p>This visualization resulted in interesting findings that may be different from fans' expectations. Fans are familiar
        with the typical models and social media influencers in each season, but when looking at how they actually fared in the
        competition, it is clear that contestants working in the Human Services and Health segments have historically been more
        successful. This includes common job titles like Nanny, Hairstylist, and Nurse. We can infer from this that since people
        with human-focused jobs tend to be more personable, caring, and helpful, they are more suitable contestants on the show.
    </p>
<h2>Insights Across Visualizations</h2>
    <p>Our three visualizations also work together to provide more insights. For instance, we can see on the map that
        there have been many contestants from the most populous states, such as California and Florida, that are sent
        home before the halfway point of the show. This may be due to the fact that people from these states are
        associated with jobs that tend not to perform as well, including models, aspiring actresses, and even dolphin trainers.
    </p>
    <p>We hope that these insights are useful to Bachelor fans, because they will be able to keep these patterns in mind
        when watching the show and will be able to more confidently predict which contestants will be more
        successful. Our visualization should also be useful to future Bachelors, as they can browse the typical group of
        contestants that appears on each season, and also future contestants so that they can predict their own
        success and figure out which traits are best for them to emphasize.
    </p>
<h2>Further Development</h2>
    <p>This project could be further developed to provide more insights. We did not have data for the bachelors on each season,
        but it would have been interesting to see how the Bachelor's characteristics correlate to his choices of contestants.
