<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
<p>As avid fans of reality TV, we are fascinated by the phenomenon that is the Bachelor/Bachelorette universe. Each season, millions of people create brackets and even bet money on the contestants and their outcomes. Using previous years’ Bachelor data, we hope to give people actionable insights and trends for their brackets and gossip among friends. Although on the surface analyzing reality TV may seem purely trivial, we hope to use this data to provide insights to help win your bracket or find your next lover in real life.</p>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<p>We would like to create a visualization based on the outcome data from previous seasons to determine how certain characteristics correlate with contestant outcomes. We can answer questions like: </p>
<ul>
<li>Which occupations get sent home the earliest?</li>
<li>Which hometown or home state has had the most success?</li>
<li>What is the threshold of age that you need to win?</li>
<li>What characteristics make a contestant likely to be the next Bachelor/Bachelorette?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our visualization will allow the show's viewers to make more accurate bets and predictions on the contestant outcomes. It will be an interactive, entertaining platform for fans to explore the show's history and statistics. </p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<a href="https://data.world/amandanovak/bachelor-contestants-with-instagram-follower-count/workspace/data-dictionary">Data Source 1</a>
<p>We got this from data.world which is an innovative platform with open source datasets and was published on 8/28/2017. Two files are given, one in an xlsx and one given in a csv. We will manipulate, append, and combine both of those into another csv file, which we will combine and then serve using a python server for our data analysis.</p>
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brianbgonz/the-bachelorette-contestants#bachelors.csv">Data Source 2</a>
<p>We also have additional information on the bachelor for each individual season from Kaggle, so we can compare the bachelor’s characteristics with that of the candidates.</p>

<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>We expect some data cleanup. We have two files with different categories and different missing data elements, so we’ll combine the two into a new dataset and scrape the missing data.</p>

<h2>Must-Have Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Trees that show the week-by-week outcomes of each contestant in each season</li>
<li>Charts comparing the outcomes by characteristics (ex. Home state, occupation industry)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optional Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>List the features which you consider to be nice to have, but not critical.</li>
<li>Map with home city and state</li>
<li>Instagram follower count analysis</li>
<li>Comparison of similarities between the bachelor and the contestants</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Schedule</h2>
<p>We plan to divide work by assigning each team member a visualization that will be incorporated into a cohesive web page. We will meet weekly to catch up on our progress, help each other improve our work, and integrate all of our parts.<br>
Group Meeting - 3/25<br>
Group Meeting - 4/1</p>
<ul>
    <li>Submit Milestone I - a functional project prototype (due Apr 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Group Meeting - 4/8<br>
Group Meeting - 4/15</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit Milestone II - a fully functional prototype (due Apr 15)</li>
<li>Prepare for In-class user studies (Apr 18)</li>
</ul>
<p>Group Meeting - 4/22</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare for Final project presentation (Apr 23 & 25)</li>
</ul>
<p>Group Meeting - 4/27, 4/28, or 4/29</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit Final project submission & peer evaluations (due Apr 29)</li></ul>
<h2>Visualization Design</h2>
<p>Design sketches for our visualization are shown below. The primary view will be an interactive tree depicting the week-by-week progress of contestants on a given season of The Bachelor. Users will then be able to choose amongst various characteristics to gain more information; for instance, looking at the breakdown of previous Bachelor contestants’ outcomes based on their occupations, or finding out which U.S. states have had the best performance on the show. In terms of visual encodings, we will use height/size in bar graphs to depict frequency and success on the show. We will also use a consistent color scale wherever necessary that encodes contestants’ outcomes.</p>
